The Food and Drug Administration is walking back President Trump's statement that the agency has approved the[anti-malarial drug chloroquine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/chloroquine-malaria-drug-treat-coronavirus-doctors/story?id=69664561)as a treatment modality for COVID-19.

No drug has yet been approved to fight the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. But some physicians and hospitals have been using the drug off-label, and manufacturers say they'll soon be experiencing shortages.

The University of Minnesota is[conducting a study](https://med.umn.edu/news-events/covid-19-clinical-trial-launches-university-minnesota)to see whether chloroquine can protect people who have coronavirus exposure. Host Robin Young talks to**[Dr. Len Horovitz](https://www.lenhorovitz.com/)**, a pulmonologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.
